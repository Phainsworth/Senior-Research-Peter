The objective of this project is to identify the most effective ad-blockers for Google Chrome in terms of blocking ads. With the growing prevalence of online ads, users are often bombarded with intrusive and unwanted ads that negatively impact their browsing experience. Ad-blockers provide a solution by blocking these ads, thereby improving the browsing experience.
To determine the most effective ad-blockers for Google Chrome, a set of websites with varying degrees of ad content will be selected, including news sites, social media sites, and e-commerce sites. Different ad-blockers for Google Chrome, such as uBlock Origin, AdBlock Plus, and AdGuard, will be installed and enabled, and configured to use the same filter lists.
The results of this project will provide valuable insights into the most effective ad-blockers for Google Chrome. This information can be used by users to choose an ad-blocker that best suits their needs, and by developers to improve the performance and effectiveness of their ad-blockers. Ultimately, this project aims to improve the browsing experience for users by identifying the most effective ad-blockers for Google Chrome.
